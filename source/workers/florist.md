Welcome to the Florist's Information Site.

The Florist is another specialist of the your Colony's production. The Florist will plant flowers and other plant items in their plots, provided that the [Deliveryman](../workers/deliveryman) (or yourself) give it all the compost or bone-meal to do it.  

Click here for full information about the [Flowershop's hut](../buildings/flowershop) block and using your [Building Tool](../items/buildingtool). Once the hut is placed, the Florist will be automatically assigned (or you can manually assign one with the best [Traits](../systems/workerinfo) for a Florist if you changed this in the setting tab in the [Town Hall's GUI](../../source/buildings/townhall).

You now officially have a Florist, **CONGRATULATIONS!**
